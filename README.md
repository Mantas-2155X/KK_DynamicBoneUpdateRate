# KK_DynamicBoneUpdateRate  

This plugin allows you to change the DynamicBone and DynamicBone_Ver02 update rate.  
Using this you no longer get skirt/breasts/other dynamic bones jittering when your game is over 60FPS.  

The default value is set to **60**. Please adjust the value to your monitors refresh rate if you're using VSync or to any other value you wish to use.
